# Portfolio Builder - Project 3

## Project Name: 
Portfolio Builder

## Project Description: 
Portfolio builder is an interactive online portfolio template that allows you to plug in information and build a cohesive portfolio. 

## User Story: 
As a user, I would like to create a portfolio by choosing from an unrivaled set of best-in-class templates and to customize the design to fit my personal style and professional needs.


## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
